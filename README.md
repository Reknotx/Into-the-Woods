# Into-The-Woods
 
## **Short Description**
 
Into the Woods is a top-down, randomly generated, tile-based dungeon crawler in which players will be tasked with exploring the map to defeat the boss and find their missing master, all in a matter of 3 in-game days. Within this adventure, the players will be able to cast spells, brew potions, and collect items that will make defeating combatants and the final boss an easier mission. 

## **Long Description**

### _**Major Features**_
Into the Woods is chalked full of features, but some of the main ones include a randomly generating 4x4 tilemap, spell casting, potion brewing, a day-night cycle, nine different enemy types, and two different boss battles. 

### _**Tile Map**_
Each time that the player presses play on the game, a new map will be generated, creating a variability of gameplay for each playthrough. On top of the randomly generated tiles, another variable lies in the critical path that the player may take in order to get to the final destination and defeat the boss. Though these tiles’ experiences have been predetermined by the level designers, the way in which you will encounter them and the loot that you will receive after completing each room will change each time the player plays the game.

### _**Spell Casting and Potion Brewing**_
There are four different spells that the player can get, starting with the basic attack spell. The other three spells must be found while adventuring throughout the map and there is no guarantee that the player will find all of them. These additional spells include a freeze spell (freezes enemies in place or stops them from shooting), a barrier breaker spell (breaks through specific assets on the maps), and a protection spell (puts a protective bubble around the player for a short period of time). In addition to learning new spells, the player may also learn new potion recipes and brew them at a cauldron with ingredients they find in their exploration. The player will start with an initial knowledge of a health potion, but can also learn and brew a super health potion (restores all health to the player), invisibility potion (makes the player invisible to enemies for a short time), double damage potion (gives player 2x damage for a short time), night-walker potion (allows player passage to a night-only room - one-time use), and a frozen heart potion (gives player immunity to freeze damage for a short time). Finding any of these new spells and potion recipes will also be a random variable in the player’s gameplay.

### _**Day-Night Cycle**_
One of the resources in the game is time. The day-night cycle will limit players from taking too much time in the game as the player is only allowed three in-game days (eighteen minutes total) to find and beat the boss. Additionally, during the night, there are other rooms along the path that can open for the player to explore and potentially get some higher-tier loot.

### _**Loot**_
There are many different items that can be collected in the game and it will be another feature that is random for the player each time that they play. These different items include…

  * Totem - Will grant the player an extra life.
  
  * Lucky Penny - When harvesting potion ingredients from plants in the forest, the player will obtain 2 ingredients instead of 1.
  
  * Attack Candy - Gives the player +1 damage to their attack spell for as long as they have it in their inventory. Can be collected from chests.
  
  * Balloon Bouquet - Will equip the player with 3 balloons and absorbs 3 hits before the player takes damage. Can be obtained from chests.
  
  * Heart - Will regenerate a singular heart to the player’s HP. Two Peas in a Pod - Allows the player to have a double shot of their attack spell.
  
  * Compass - Spells cast by the player will now track the enemies.
  
  * Avocado - Will give players one extra heart in their health bar (the same way that an extra heart is given with a golden apple in Minecraft).

### _**Enemies**_
There are nine different enemies in the game and two different boss battles that the player can encounter. Each class of the enemies has a unique trait plus some additional behavior to vary. Class A enemies are stationary turret enemies with additional behaviors such as freezing your spell cast and enacting bleed damage. Class B enemies are mobile enemies with no particular pattern. Their additional behaviors include dropping bombs around the map and putting up a short shield that will inhibit the player from dealing damage to them. Class C enemies will chase the player around the map. Additional behaviors include exploding on contact and splitting into two. The two different bosses are reminiscent of the Class A and the Class C enemies. Boss A is a turret enemy that will deal bleeding and freezing status effects to the player. Boss B is achasing and splitting enemy that exists in three waves of a split.

### _**Modes of Play**_
Another fun feature for player customization of gameplay is that prior to starting the game, the player may choose between different modes of play (larger map, harder enemies, or both of the previously mentioned) as well as the theme of the forest they are able to set off in. The player can choose to explore the standard evergreen forest, a bioluminescent forest, a mushroom forest, or a floral forest. Each forest has a different set of assets and visual mood.
